        "reasoning": "The first two events in 'system_actual' closely match in timing, days of week, and event recurrence period. However, errors include one event missing ('Engineering Standup' for April with incorrect recurrence), the 'Sales Standup' uses incorrect color, 'blue' instead of 'green', and incorrect end recurrence date '2044-04-30' instead of '2044-05-01'. Given these deficiencies, the calendar comparison yields a low score.",

    {
        "reasoning": "In the actual system, the first five events match the system completely in all parameters, but the 'Weekly Team Lunch' time and date of occurrence are modified drastically (1 hour shift and starting a month later), which disrupts the arrangement slightly but significantly. This reduces the score but does not invalidate the comparison as most events are still synchronized accurately.",
        "score": 7
    },
    {
        "reasoning": "The 'system_actual' calendar introduces several new events and omits all from the original 'system' list, making it completely different. None of the events, times, dates, nor details match despite calendar structure, thus leading to the minimum valid score.",

        "reasoning": "Most events match between system and system_actual with correct titles, colors and timings except for 'Junior Staff Training'. The days of the week for this event are changed significantly (should only include Wednesday), and the time has been modified slightly. Given this discrepancy in one event, the score reflects a nearly but not completely accurate reproduction.",

    {
        "reasoning": "All events match perfectly in title, color, and days of the week. The 'Junior Staff Training' event, however, has incorrect days of week association and the first event missed adding start and end recurrence parameters. These discrepancies reduce the score.",

These issues moderately affect the system alignment and user experience.",
