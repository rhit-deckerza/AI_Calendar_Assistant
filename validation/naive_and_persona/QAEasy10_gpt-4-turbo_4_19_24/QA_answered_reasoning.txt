For an evening class, I recommend scheduling your language class in such a way that it doesn't interfere with typical dinner times and allows you enough time after a typical workday. \n\nIdeal times could be:\n- Early evening classes, perhaps from 5:00 PM to 6:30 PM.\n- A later time slot like 7:00 PM to 8:30 PM if you prefer post-dinner learning.\n\nThese time slots should give you enough flexibility around standard meal times and personal obligations.\n\nWould you like to set up your language class from 5:00 PM to 6:30 PM every Wednesday or would another time suit you better?"
