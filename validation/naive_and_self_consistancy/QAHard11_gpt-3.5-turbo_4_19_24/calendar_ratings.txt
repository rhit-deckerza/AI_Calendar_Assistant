        "reasoning": "Although several events matched closely, the 'Weekly Team Lunch' on Wednesdays had several discrepancies including different timing, start date, and end date as well as differing titles.

        "reasoning": "The actual system completely lacks events matching the single system event, with entirely different events present. No details from the system event like day, timings, or title match any events in system_actual, justifying the lowest score.",

        "reasoning": "The 'Morning Briefing' event lacks a required attribute, 'startRecur' and 'endRecur', which leads to a substantial deduction as this is critical information for recurring events. The rest of the attributes do match across both events.",
