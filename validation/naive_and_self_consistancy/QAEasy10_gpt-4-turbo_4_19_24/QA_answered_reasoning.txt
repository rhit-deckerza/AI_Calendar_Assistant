Tuesday is suitable as it does not contain any other events based on the provided calendar.\n\nHere is the updated calendar with the new weekly team meeting added.\n\n\n\nRationale for this choice:\n1. The selected time (10:00 AM to 12:00 PM on Tuesdays) does not overlap with any existing events.\n2. Tuesday mornings are free in the current schedule, making it an ideal timeframe for a team meeting without causing disruptions or rearrangements of other planned activities.\n3.

            "response": "Based on the existing calendar, we see a daily recurring event titled \"Morning Meditation\" from 6:00 AM to 6:30 AM. Assuming transitions and commute time, the mornings are probably a bit rushed to schedule a new event.\n\nFor your request to attend a language class every Wednesday evening, the options depend on typical working hour constraints and personal availability. Here are some recommendations:\n\n1. **Early Evening Class**: Starting the class around 5:30 PM could be ideal if you finish standard work hours by then.\n2. **Mid-Evening Class**: A class beginning at 7:00 PM allows for some downtime or other commitments immediately after work.\n3. **Later Evening Class**: Starting at 8:00 PM might suit a more relaxed evening pace or other post-work activities.\n\nAssuming no other existing evening commitments since they aren't listed in your current calendar, I would recommend considering a Mid-Evening Class start time at 7:00 PM. This timing tends to balance between finishing up work, having an early dinner, and then attending the class. An 8:00 PM ending would generally be workable, giving time afterward for winding down before bed.\n\nWould you like to proceed with this recommended schedule, or prefer another timing? If the current timing sounds good, I can add this to your calendar."

Change the day from Monday ([1]) to Friday ([5]).\n2. Modify the start time from 08:00 AM to 07:30 AM. The session duration remains the same, so the end time will now be 08:30 AM.\n\nEfficiently, this change satisfies your request without causing any disruptions or conflicts in your current calendar structure.

The next Friday from the current date (19th April 2024) is April 26th, 2024, and hence the start date for the recurring event is updated to this date to ensure alignment with the timeline of your request."
