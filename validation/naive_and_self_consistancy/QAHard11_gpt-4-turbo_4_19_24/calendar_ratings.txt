However, the days of some events differ significantly, their color for some events have changed, and recurrence times and start dates have discrepancies. Thus, it affects the applicability of system_actual as a viable representation of system.",

All other properties of the remaining events were correctly aligned, which holds substantial accuracy, hence the score.",

        "reasoning": "The system_actual has multiple additional events and changes such as different timings (changed all of them), and the content of one event significantly changed its timing ('Team Building'). None of the specified events in the system were perfectly replicated in system_actual. Given the substantial deviations in properties and structure, the score is lowered while still recognizing some consistency in titles.",

        "reasoning": "While all events are listed, there are issues such as the day patterns for 'Client Strategy Meeting' and a change in recurrence dates for some events. This misalignment affects scheduling consistency but preserves the general structure and most attributes. Hence, it leads to a decent but not high score.",

        "reasoning": "Most of the events in the system_actual have matching details from the system, but the Junior Staff Training has a changed day pattern and color, reducing the overall similarity.

        "reasoning": "The system_actual reproduces the first two events accurately but changes the timing and adds a slight change to the title of the thirds event ('Marketing Review' to 'Weekly Marketing Review'), indicating discrepancies that may affect specific use cases, particularly around marketing reviews, hence the score.",
