Continue the current engineering standup series until the end of April 2024.\n2. Add a new series for sales standups starting in May 2024, occurring on alternate weeks to the engineering standups.\n3. Schedule sales standups at the same time (10:00 AM to 11:00 AM) on the same days (Mondays and Wednesdays).\n\nGiven that the engineering standups are currently set to end on April 30, 2024, we can follow this pattern:\n- **Week 1 & 3 (May):** Engineering Standups.\n- **Week 2 & 4 (May):** Sales Standups.\n\n### New Calendar Configuration:\n- Engineering standup remains unchanged until April 30, 2024.\n- Starting May 1, 2024:\n  - Sales standups occur on alternating weeks (May 6, May 8, May 20, and May 22).\n  - Engineering standups continue on alternating weeks (May 13, May 15, May 27, and May 29), and so forth.\n\nHere is the revised calendar configuration:\n\n\n\n### Explanation:\nThis setup ensures that both the engineering and sales teams have their respective standups alternating every other week on the same days and times as previously scheduled for engineering standups. Adjustments use the original time slots to maintain consistency in the scheduling pattern, minimizing confusion and facilitating smooth transitions between the types of meetings."

Since the session is bi-weekly, it avoids unnecessary frequency, which helps in balancing the week\u2019s workload.\n\n**Proposed Options:**\n1. **Mondays from 11:00 AM to 12:00 PM:** This slot is free and follows right after an existing meeting, possibly making it convenient for continuity for some staff.\n2. **Tuesdays from 10:00 AM to 11:00 AM:** Completely free and aligns with the preference for late morning sessions.\n\n**Selection:**\nOption 2 (Tuesdays from 10:00 AM to 11:00 AM) is more suitable as it does not compact events tightly as on Mondays and provides a clear, separate time dedicated solely for the training without immediate preceding events. Additionally, placing the training early on Tuesday provides a fresh focus in the week.\n\n**Implementation:**\nAdding the bi-weekly training session on Tuesdays, starting from the 24th of April, 2024.\n\nLet's integrate this into your calendar:\n\n\n\nThe new bi-weekly training session for junior staff has been successfully added to the calendar without any conflicts with other events, providing a regular and uninterrupted learning environment."
