It lists new event creation and gives specific dates, color differentiation, and mentions non-recurring beyond May. There are clear detailed steps laid out in the explanation.",
        "accuracy_reasoning": "The solution addresses the requirement to alternate events but additionally creates a new recurring event for sales standups without clear directive from the user to do so, making it somewhat inaccurate. Moreover, both meetings are mentioned to start from May 1, which could be misaligned without knowing the exact days they should alternate.",
