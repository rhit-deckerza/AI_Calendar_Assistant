The response also clearly mentions maintaining the original meeting schedule and adds the different title for sales meetings.",
        "accuracy_reasoning": "The system incorrectly interprets the user's request. The user asked for the existing 'engineering standup' meetings to start alternating between 'sales' and 'engineering' topics, which implies modifying the current events rather than adding new ones. Thus, the system's plan to add new meetings does not accurately address the user's intent to modify existing ones.",

However, the explanation for adding a conflicting event during an already occupied time is lacking in clarity, creating potential confusion.",

This directly conflicts with the existing schedule and does not comply with the user's request for a new, non-conflicting event.",

        "accuracy_reasoning": "The accuracy is low because the system schedules the event for Tuesdays, a day that wasn't listed among the days with available time slots by the user. User mentioned having slots on Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays. The choice of Tuesday does not align with the request or the user's calendar.",

Suggesting 9:30 conflicts with the sales update meeting and fails to accurately acknowledge existing events, thus only partially fulfilling the user's need for a clear morning schedule.",
