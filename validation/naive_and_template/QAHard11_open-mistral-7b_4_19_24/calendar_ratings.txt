For instance, it combines Engineering Standup events from multiple configurations into a single configuration with changed dates, also combining Sales Standup events but altering colors and dates. The events are generally recognized but presented incorrectly with significant date errors and wrong colors for one entry.",

All modifications and additions significantly diverge from the original set, especially altering fundamental event properties like allDay and adding extra events.",
