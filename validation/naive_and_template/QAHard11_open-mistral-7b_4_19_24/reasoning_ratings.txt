The user's request to alternate between 'engineering standups' and 'sales standups' implies a need for creating new event types and alternating them weekly or bi-weekly, but the system does not specify how it will handle this switch in detail (like event creation or specific alternation between sessions).",

This step-by-step approach in evaluating each day of the week and looking for potential openings is logical and clearly explained.",

The user's existing schedule does not clearly indicate any completely free day which could accommodate the new event without any overlap if the existing patterns are followed.
