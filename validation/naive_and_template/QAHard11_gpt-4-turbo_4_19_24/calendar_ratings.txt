        "reasoning": "This scenario shows a complete mismatch between the system and system_actual. Incorrect events, altered times, and colors mean that the actual system is very different from the expected setup, providing no correlation or accuracy relative to the input.",

        "reasoning": "While the events such as 'Daily Standup' and 'Project Sync' are accurately replicated, significant discrepancies exist with the 'Marketing Review' including the incorrect timing and a complete change in event title, which is crucial for its identity.",
