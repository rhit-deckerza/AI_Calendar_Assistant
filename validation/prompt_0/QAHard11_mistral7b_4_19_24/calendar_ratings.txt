It shows a slight deviation in the \"Weekly Team Lunch\" and \"Client Calls\" events in system_actual that differ either in title or color from the system definition, along with one additional event differing entirely (Team Lunch with color brown instead of yellow and title change). Despite most events matching, these discrepancies lower the similarity score.",

        "reasoning": "The third scenario shows a drastically different system_actual with incorrect times, totally different event titles like 'Yoga' and 'Work' compared to 'Weekly Team Building', and additional events not listed in the system. The events' durations and details do not align except 'Work' shares only some schedule similarities.",

        "reasoning": "In the fourth case, system_actual is formatted completely differently with no 'startRecur' or 'endRecur' details included and an additional unlisted event ('Weekly Client Strategy Meeting'), conflicting with the structure and details in the system. This omits critical scheduling information leading to a very low similarity.",

        "reasoning": "The final comparison identified almost exact matches for all events from system except for the 'Junior Staff Training' which had an expanded occurrence day which deviates from 'system'.
