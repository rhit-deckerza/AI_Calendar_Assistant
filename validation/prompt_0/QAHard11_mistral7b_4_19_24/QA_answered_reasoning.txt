The current engineering standup event is included in the calendar as well.\n\nFirst, I'll confirm that the given JSON in the calendar represents an engineering standup event. The title \"Engineering Standup\" matches the expected name.\n\nNext, I'll create a new JSON object for the sales standup event, and set its title to \"Sales Standup\" to distinguish it from the engineering standup event.
