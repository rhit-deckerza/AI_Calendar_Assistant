Assuming the meetings will be on Mondays and Wednesdays like current engineering standups, and that they will retain the same time slot (10:00 to 11:00), alternating between the two types would mean:\n\n- Engineering Standup: May 1, 15, 29 (Wednesday)\n- Sales Standup: May 6, 20, May 8, 22 (Monday and Wednesday)\n\nEach event will repeat on its respective days for May, and I will assume you would like this pattern to continue indefinitely, setting the end date 20 years from now.\n\nHere\u2019s the updated calendar with alternating standup meetings:\n\n\n\nThis schedule starts with an engineering meeting on Wednesday, May 1, 2024, and alternates each session with a sales meeting starting from the following Monday, May 6, 2024. Each session keeps the same time as your original request.
