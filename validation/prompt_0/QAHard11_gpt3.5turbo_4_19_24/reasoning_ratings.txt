The user requested to alternate Engineering and Sales standups starting from the next month, but the response failed to directly transform or modify the existing 'Engineering Standup' events. Instead, it mentions adding a new 'Sales Standup' while not specifying modifications to the original standup's pattern for alternating purposes. Hence, it doesn’t meet the exact user request.",
