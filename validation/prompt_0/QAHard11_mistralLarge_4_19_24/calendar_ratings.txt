The second event type has been confused between Engineering and Sales across different systems. Also, all system and system_actual events have different endRecur dates, leading to deviations from the system set.",

        "reasoning": "System_actual is missing the 'Weekly Team Lunch' event entirely and has times of the 'Team Lunch' event improperly altered. All other events in system_actual have matched with system in all attributes except this missing event and one modified event, resulting in a substantial difference.",

        "reasoning": "While the days of the week, recurrence, and titles match, the absence of 'startRecur' and 'endRecur' attribution in system_actual leads to a deviation. However, due to accurate representation of other attributes, the error is somewhat mitigated.",
