        "reasoning": "The first actual calendar reproduces the two events from the first original event but splits it into separate events with the correct details except the Sales Standup has incorrect color 'blue' instead of 'green'. The second actual event has divided differently, and these replicate the original in terms of days and dates, but the Sales Standup is incorrectly colored. Overall, key aspects match, but with minor discrepancies in color for one event, it lowers the similarity slightly.",

        "reasoning": "In the original calendar, there are more events than in the actual calendar. The 'Weekly Team Lunch' and 'End of Day Review' are missing, and the timing on 'Team Lunch' is modified inaccurately. This causes a significant divergence from the original setup, ultimately impacting functional alignment.",

        "reasoning": "The actual system introduces multiple new events and changes drastically from the original which has only one event, 'Weekly Team Building'. The actual system completely misses the original event in terms of title, timings, and other details, representing a low similarity.",

    {
        "reasoning": "The actual calendar has a completely new event structure for the 'Brainstorming Session', being inaccurately represented in both duration and timing, diverging from the original recurring window. This significant change alters the intention of the scheduling.",
