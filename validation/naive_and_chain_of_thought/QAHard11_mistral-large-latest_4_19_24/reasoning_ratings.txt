It clearly specifies identifying and removing the existing standup meetings, creating new separate events for sales and engineering, and ensuring they alternate. The explanation includes concrete scheduling decisions, such as setting sales standups on Mondays and engineering standups on Wednesdays, which clearly indicates an understanding of the task.",

It correctly plans to remove existing meetings starting May 2024 and sets up two new series for sales and engineering, as per the user's instruction. The response targets the correct start date and methodically addresses the user's needs for alternating meetings.",
