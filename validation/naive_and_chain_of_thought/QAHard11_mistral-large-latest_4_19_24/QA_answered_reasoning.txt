On Mondays, there's a Management Meeting from 10:00 to 11:00. On Tuesdays, there's an Executive Session from 13:00 to 15:00 starting from April 30th, 2024.

And on Fridays, starting from May 10th, 2024, there's an HR Update from 11:00 to 12:00.\n\n2. **Integrate the new event**: You've requested a bi-weekly training session for junior staff, preferably in the late mornings. To avoid conflicts with existing events, I'll look for a day and time that's consistently free. Given your preference for late mornings, I'll aim for a start time around 10:00 or 11:00 and an end time around 12:00 or 13:00.\n\n   Looking at your current calendar, Wednesdays and Fridays seem to be the best options for this new event. However, since the HR Update starts on May 10th, 2024, and recurs every Friday, I'll choose Wednesdays for the training session to avoid potential future conflicts.\n\n   I'll set the start time of the training session to 11:00 and the end time to 13:00. This time slot is currently free on Wednesdays and aligns with your preference for late mornings. Since you didn't specify a start date, I'll set the first occurrence of the training session to be on the next Wednesday, which is April 24th, 2024. As for the color, since you didn't specify one, I'll set it to the default 'blue'.\n\n3. **Rationale for each decision**: I chose Wednesdays because it's the day of the week that's consistently free in the late mornings, based on your current calendar.
