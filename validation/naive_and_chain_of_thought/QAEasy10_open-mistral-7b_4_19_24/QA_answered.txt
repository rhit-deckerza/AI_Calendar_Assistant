Rationale:\nChanging the duration of the \"Family Lunch\" event to last for two hours instead of one hour is a simple modification to the calendar data. With the updated end time of 3:00 PM, the event will now last two hours instead of one. This change does not affect any other events on the calendar and does not require any additional checks or optimizations."
