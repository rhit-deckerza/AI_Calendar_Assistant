There's also an error with the 'Sales Standup' event where the color has changed from green to blue, which contributes to further deviation. The 'endRecur' on both 'system_actual' events disagrees with the 'system' events (2044-04-30 versus 2044-05-01).",

Despite this, since all events are replicated correctly and only one minor date error, the overall alignment is high.",
