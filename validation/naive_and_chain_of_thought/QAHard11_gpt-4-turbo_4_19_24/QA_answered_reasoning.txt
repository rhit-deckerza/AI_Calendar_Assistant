            "response": "To add the new bi-weekly training session for junior staff in the late mornings, let's analyze the existing calendar entries to find an appropriate time slot that doesn't conflict with other events and suits the requested time preference.\n\n### Current Calendar Events:\n1. **Management Meeting** - Mondays, 10:00 to 11:00 \n2. **Technical Review** - Thursdays, 14:00 to 15:30\n3. **Executive Session** - Tuesdays, 13:00 to 15:00, starting from the 30th of April, 2024\n4. **HR Update** - Fridays, 11:00 to 12:00, starting from the 10th of May, 2024\n\n### Analysis:\n- To find a suitable late morning slot, we should consider times around 11:00-12:00.\n- Monday, Tuesday, and Friday already have booked sessions in the late morning to early afternoon.\n- Wednesday appears completely free, and Thursday has an event but it is in the afternoon (14:00 to 15:30).\n\n### Suggestion:\n- We can schedule the bi-weekly training for junior staff on **Wednesdays**, from **11:00 to 12:00** every two weeks. This choice avoids conflicts with existing meetings and matches the request for late mornings.\n\n### Implementation:\nTo define the bi-weekly recurrence, we'll set the session to occur every two weeks with an \u201cevery other week\u201d pattern, starting from the next Wednesday and setting a recurring end date 20 years from the start date, as a long-term placeholder. Given today's current date is the 19th of April, 2024, the closest Wednesday from today is the 24th of April, 2024.\n\nI will add this new event to the calendar:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"allDay\": false,\n    \"daysOfWeek\": [3],  // 3 represents Wednesday\n    \"startTime\": \"11:00\",\n    \"endTime\": \"12:00\",\n    \"startRecur\": \"2024-04-24\",\n    \"endRecur\": \"2044-04-24\", // Long-term recurring placeholder\n    \"title\": \"Junior Staff Training\",\n    \"color\": \"blue\"\n}\n```\n\n### Updated Calendar:\nHere is the updated calendar with the newly added bi-weekly training session:\n\n\n\nThis update slots the new training session into a free time without conflicts and adheres to your requested timing for the late mornings."
