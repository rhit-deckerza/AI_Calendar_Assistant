The system didn't provide an explicit JSON with the changes but described altering the 'daysOfWeek' and maintaining the pattern, which provides some clarity on the implementation.",

Despite acknowledging the need for alternating events (Engineering and Sales Standup), it failed to include the actual JSON structure changes. Although it did mention retaining the Engineering event for Fridays and adding Sales every other day, it erroneously set Engineering meetings for Fridays, while initially, they occurred on Tuesdays and Thursdays.
