        "reasoning": "In the first pair, 'system_actual' consolidates two separate Engineering Standup events into one, starting from 2024-05-01, which compromises the specificity of the original schedule. Additionally, the Sales Standup event starts on a different date and an ending date typo causes it to repeat incorrectly compared to the original. The second Engineering Standup event is missing entirely.",

        "reasoning": "The actual system is missing several events compared to the system data including: Weekly Team Lunch and Development Time. Moreover, the Team Lunch present in the actual data starts and ends on incorrect dates and its timing is shifted by an hour. Additionally, the color for Team Lunch does not match the original, impacting the overall score significantly.",

        "reasoning": "The system_actual has significant discrepancies like the Client Strategy Meeting being on an entirely different day and with an incorrect startRecur and endRecur. Additionally, the color for several events like the Junior Staff Training and Marketing Review has changed which affects how these events are categorized and accessed in a real-world application.",

        "reasoning": "While 'system_actual' retains the Strategy Meeting accurately, the Brainstorming Session start time has been shifted back an hour, starts two days earlier, and the color changed which can affect user recognition and planning. Thus, timing and attribute errors are penalized.",
