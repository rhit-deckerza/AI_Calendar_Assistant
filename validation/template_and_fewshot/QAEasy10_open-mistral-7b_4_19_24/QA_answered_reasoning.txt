Here's how I'll modify the calendar:\n\nFirst, I'll add a new calendar event with the title \"Morning Meditations\", set the start time to 6am, the end time to 6:30am, and the duration to 30 minutes. Since you didn't specify a color, I'll use the default blue color for this event. Finally, since you requested this event every day, I'll set the daysOfWeek array to include all seven days of the week.\n\nHere's the updated calendar in JSON format:\n\n```json\n[\n  {\n    \"allDay\": false,\n    \"daysOfWeek\": [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6],\n    \"startTime\": \"06:00\",\n    \"endTime\": \"06:30\",\n    \"startRecur\": \"2024-04-19\",\n    \"endRecur\": \"2044-04-19\",\n    \"title\": \"Morning Meditations\",\n    \"color\": \"blue\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"allDay\": false,\n    \"daysOfWeek\": [1, 2, 3, 4, 5],\n    \"startTime\": \"09:00\",\n    \"endTime\": \"17:00\",\n    \"startRecur\": \"2024-04-19\",\n    \"endRecur\": \"2044-04-19\",\n    \"title\": \"Work\",\n    \"color\": \"blue\"\n  }\n]\n```\n\nWith this updated calendar, you'll have morning meditations scheduled every day at 6am, and your work schedule will remain the same.

Since the user is asking for a language class in the evening, I recommend adding the language class event after the work event. A common duration for language classes is 1.5 to 2 hours. I'll choose 1.5 hours as a default duration.\n\nNow, I'll suggest a suitable start time for the event and calculate the end time accordingly:\n\nLet's assume the language class starts at 6:30 PM.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"allDay\": false,\n  \"daysOfWeek\": [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5],\n  \"startTime\": \"18:30\",\n  \"endTime\": \"20:00\",\n  \"startRecur\": \"2024-04-19\",\n  \"endRecur\": \"2044-04-19\",\n  \"title\": \"Language Class\",\n  \"color\": \"blue\"\n}\n```\n\nWith this addition, the user's updated calendar will look like:\n\n```json\n[\n  {\n    \"allDay\": false,\n    \"daysOfWeek\": [1, 2, 3, 4, 5],\n    \"startTime\": \"09:00\",\n    \"endTime\": \"17:00\",\n    \"startRecur\": \"2024-04-19\",\n    \"endRecur\": \"2044-04-19\",\n    \"title\": \"Work\",\n    \"color\": \"blue\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"allDay\": false,\n    \"daysOfWeek\": [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5],\n    \"startTime\": \"18:30\",\n    \"endTime\": \"20:00\",\n    \"startRecur\": \"2024-04-19\",\n    \"endRecur\": \"2044-04-19\",\n    \"title\": \"Language Class\",\n    \"color\": \"blue\"\n  }\n]\n```\n\nIf the user wants a different duration for the language class or a different start time, they can modify the suggested event accordingly."
