Common times people choose are either immediately after standard work hours or later in the evening. Here are two time options you might consider:\n\n1. **6:00 PM to 7:00 PM**: This timing is immediately after standard work hours and could be a convenient transition to an evening activity, allowing for dinner and other personal activities later in the evening.\n\n2. **7:30 PM to 8:30 PM**: This slightly later slot allows some buffer after work hours for rest, travel, or other commitments before attending the class.\n\nIf these times or any other specifics conflict with other undisclosed commitments, please adjust accordingly. Once you establish a time more aligned with your schedule, this class can be added to your calendar accordingly.\n\nWould you like to choose one of these recommended times or specify another time for your language class?"
