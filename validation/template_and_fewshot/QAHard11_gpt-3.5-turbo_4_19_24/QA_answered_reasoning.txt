Considering your current calendar events, we have some options for the team building event:\n\n1. **Option 1: Team Building Event on Mondays after Work**\n   - The team building event could be scheduled for Mondays after your work hours. This would allow for a relaxed environment post-work to engage in team activities. Given that you have no commitments on Monday evenings, this could be a suitable slot for the team building event.\n\n2. **Option 2: Team Building Event on Fridays After Lunch**\n   - Another option would be to have the team building event on Fridays after your Lunch Break. This way, it could act as a nice segue into the weekend and provide a fun way to end the work week.\n\n3. **Option 3: Team Building Event on Wednesday Mornings**\n   - Alternatively, holding the team building event on Wednesday mornings could provide a mid-week boost to team morale and productivity. It would break up the work routine nicely.\n\nEach of these options has its own benefits, so it would be advisable to choose the one that aligns best with your team's preferences and schedule. Let me know which option you prefer or if you have a specific time in mind for the team building event."
