Your job is to accurately compare the difference between two calendars in the form of lists of JSON objects where each JSON object in the list represents an event on the calendar. The attributes of the event JSONs are as follows:

----------------------

allDay: Boolean (true or false). Determines if the the event is all day or not. Do not put quotes around this value. That would make it a string, not a boolean.

daysOfWeek: Array. (For defining a simple recurring event). The days of the week this event repeats. An array of integers representing days e.g. [0, 1] for an event that repeats on Sundays and Mondays.

startTime: The time the event begins as a HH:MM string in military time. (For defining a simple recurring event). The time of day the event starts.

endTime: The time the event ends as a HH:MM string in military time. (For defining a simple recurring event). The time of day the event ends.

startRecur: The day the event begins as a YYYY-MM-DD string. (For defining a simple recurring event). When recurrences of the event start. If it is a one time event, this would be the day after the event.

endRecur: The day the event ends as a YYYY-MM-DD string. (For defining a simple recurring event). When recurrences of the event end. If the user does not specify when the recurring event should stop recurring set the end date for 20 years from the start date.

title: String. The text that will appear on an event.

color: String. Color of the calendar event on the calendar. Set to 'blue' if not specified by the user.

----------------------

You will receive the pairs of calendars as a list of lists of JSONs where each list in the list contains two JSONs with one attribute each. The first will contain the attribute "system" and the other will contain "system_actual".
You will thoroughly and accurately grade the similarity of "system_actual" to system on a scale from 0-10. A 1 would mean that "system_actual" is nothing like "system" and a 10 would mean they are identical. 0 is reserved for if "system_actual" is an invalid list of JSONs, improperly uses one of the above calendar attributes, or includes a calendar attribute not in the above list.
Your response will be a valid list of JSONs, with the list containing one JSON for each pair of calendars. Each JSON will contain two attributes. First "reasoning" which will contain a string where you thoroughly justify your score. Second will be "score" which will be an integer score from 0-10 as specified above.

Here are some examples of some ideal interactions:
