        "reasoning": "Several events from the system_actual align perfectly with the system ones. However, there's a significant mistake with the timing and somewhat with the renaming of an event (weekly team lunch changed to team lunch and the time altered, plus other missing events), which decreases the effectiveness of the calendar sync.",

        "reasoning": "Large portions of the event attributes match; however, there are some serious discrepancies in the recurrence details for 'Client Strategy Meeting' (different days and dates, and color alteration) which leads to misrepresentations of critical scheduling details, considerably affecting the functionality and usage.",

    {
        "reasoning": "While most individual events match in both title and timing, there's a serious mismatch in the redefined event 'Junior Staff Training', altering days, timing, and color. This inconsistency is enough to severely undermine the functional resemblance of the calendars.",
