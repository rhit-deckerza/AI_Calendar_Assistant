The response starts by addressing the initial morning meditation addition clearly, but then introduces other events such as yogas schedule changes and doctor's appointments without any prompt from the user in the immediate request. This mixture of unsolicited interactions makes the response confusing and poorly structured.",
        "accuracy_reasoning": "The accuracy is very poor because the system's response does not solely focus on adding the requested morning meditation. Instead, it includes multiple unsolicited actions like altering yoga schedules and deleting the newly added morning meditation, which contradicts the user's initial request. Such unrelated modifications substantially deviate from the user's specific inquiry.",

This amalgamation of multiple unrelated actions creates confusion about what is being specifically addressed.",
