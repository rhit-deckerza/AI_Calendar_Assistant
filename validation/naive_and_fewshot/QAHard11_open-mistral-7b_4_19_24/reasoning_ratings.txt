Additionally, the system misidentifies the existing days (Tuesdays and Fridays for engineering) as the system responded with incorrect days for standups (Wednesdays and Saturdays for sales).

Additionally, the user inquired about a weekly slot, not specifying it should be all day or on Fridays. Thereby, the event added does not accurately match the user's open-ended query.",
